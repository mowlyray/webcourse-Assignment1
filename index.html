            Dr. Yunus envisions a future where poverty is relegated to museums—a
            distant memory of a problem humanity once faced but has now
            overcome. Through the groundbreaking concept of microfinance and the
            establishment of Grameen Bank, Dr. Yunus demonstrated how access to
            credit can empower the poorest members of society, especially women,
            to break free from the cycle of poverty. His vision is rooted in the
            belief that every human being, regardless of their circumstances,
            has unlimited potential.
